A summarization of genomic features will be performed on pathway and gene set level. Different models will be applied in order to extract an activity score that could be further used in order to cluster the AD and PD patients into different sub-groups according to pathways and motifs. The input dataset and the pipeline for extraction of pathway activite profile matrices is shown below:
